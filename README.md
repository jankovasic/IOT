## Project Description

The IOT project is aimed at exploring the potential of connected devices and sensors to automate processes and gather data. The project involves setting up an IOT network that collects data from sensors, processes the data on a server, and provides useful insights via a user-friendly interface. The project can be used as a starting point for further exploration into smart systems, automation, and remote monitoring.

## Features

- **Sensor Integration:** Connects and reads data from various sensors (e.g., temperature, humidity, motion).
- **Data Processing:** Real-time data processing and analysis.
- **Dashboard:** User interface for monitoring sensor data.
- **Alerts and Notifications:** Set thresholds for sensor data and receive notifications when conditions are met.
- **Scalability:** Easily expandable with additional sensors and devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages:** Python, JavaScript
- **Frameworks:** Flask (for backend API), React (for frontend)
- **Database:** SQLite/MySQL
- **Tools:** Git, Docker (optional for containerization)
- **Communication Protocols:** MQTT, HTTP

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jankovasic/IOT.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd IOT
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies for the backend:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Install the required dependencies for the frontend:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

5. (Optional) Set up and configure your database. Modify the `config.py` or `.env` file with your database credentials if needed.

## Usage

1. Start the backend server:

    ```bash
    cd backend
    python app.py
    ```

2. Start the frontend application:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm start
    ```

3. Access the application by opening your web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3000`.

4. Connect your IOT devices to the server using the provided API endpoints. The data from the devices will be automatically displayed on the dashboard.
